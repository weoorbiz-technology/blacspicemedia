Highly inspired from the special training conducted for the inmates by Saleem Hadi, this programme highly challenges one to tell stories with the limited resources at hand. Unlike the iCAPTURE© / iTHIRAI©, this programme makes one to tell stories within four walls in a very short duration, making them conjure ideas and putting it to action. THIRAIYARAI © was first launched in 2017 when Saleem Hadi was awarded the ‘KALAI CHUDAR’ award in 2017 by Tamil News Department (Mediacorp, Singapore) for his wide range of contributions across few arts. The first run of the programme was conducted at the National Library for the Tamil students from the local universities and the response was overwhelming and positive. In the first run, students were asked to pick anyTamil poem of their choice, written by a local poet and were tasked to interpret it in their own perspectives. As a group, the students scripted, shot and produced short films based on the poems they had chosen earlier. In 2020, with the support of Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee (TLLPC), THIRAIYARAI© was carried out on ZOOM for the JC and PRE-U students where students created short films single-handedly, based on quotes they believed in their lives."
