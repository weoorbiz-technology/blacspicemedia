                    Hadi from BLACSPICE MEDIA as a trainer to work with inmates on video production skills. These
                    inmates have little formal education and he pitched his lessons at a level that all of them could
                    understand. The inmates walked away with a good basic knowledge on storyboarding, setting up of
                    cameras for archival purposes, and some more able ones could do basic editing. As a trainer, he has
                    been conscientious and his lesson plans and reports have been appropriate and thought through.</p>
